# Architecture

## Overview

`@trysac/frontend-error-capture` is a small, dependency-free TypeScript library published to npm as ES modules with type
declarations. Capture frontend errors with parsed stacks, breadcrumbs, redacted messages and URLs, stable fingerprints, dedup, rate limits and batching through an injected transport

## Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/index.ts` | Public API. Everything consumers import is exported from here. |

Add a row when you add a module. Internal modules are not re-exported unless they are part of the public API.

## Boundaries

- No runtime dependencies by default; any addition is justified in [STACK.md](STACK.md).
- No I/O at import time. Functions are pure unless their documentation says otherwise.
- Errors are thrown as built-in error types (`TypeError`, `RangeError`) with actionable messages.

## Build and distribution

`npm run build` compiles `src/` to `dist/` with `tsconfig.build.json`. Only `dist/` is published
(`files` in `package.json`).
